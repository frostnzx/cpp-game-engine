# C++ Game Engine

## Description
---
This is a C++ game engine that I developed as part of my learning journey in computer engineering. The project serves as a hands-on exploration of various game development concepts, including rendering, physics, input handling, and asset management. The primary goal of this project is to better understand game engine

## Features
---
- **Rendering**: graphics rendering using SFML graphics library.
- **Physics**: Basic collision detection and physics simulation.
- **Input Handling**: Support for keyboard, mouse, and gamepad input.
- **Asset Management**: Easy loading and management of game assets (textures, sprites, sounds).

## Installation
